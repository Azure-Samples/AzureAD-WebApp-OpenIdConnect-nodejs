There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the Microsoft identity platform (formerly Azure AD v2.0)

Check it out: [AppModelv2-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-nodejs](https://github.com/azureadquickstarts/appmodelv2-webapp-openidconnect-nodejs)

If you really need to access this Azure AD v1.0, you can navigate to the master branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
